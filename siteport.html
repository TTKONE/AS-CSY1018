    <h2> My experience</h2>
    <p class="myclass">My experience towards web development had a lot of ups and downs, I ended up struggling throughout the first few weeks of the assignment however through the help of the Internet and sources found on the Nile I managed to put everything together and make a website. My biggest struggle was when I first tried to create the CSS for the website, I was struggling on making all the website look alike and make them align the way I wanted to. I decided to make the website simple easy to use and responsive, however, I do think that there could be more changes to my website, and it could be better if more work was put into it. The journey I experienced in this module was good and helped me understand the basics of web development which will be useful in the future especially if I want to try to create a website. The Software programme I have utilised for this assignment was the Visual Studio code which I think is good for first timers like me trying to use HTML and CSS for their website, especially because of the many features that Visual Studio code has. For example, it lets you commit your changes and sends them straight to your GitHub without you uploading them individually. Visual Studio Code is much easier than other programming softwareâ€™s and the way it is laid out makes it easy to find what I need and notice my errors much easier. I also would say it's like easy to code thanks to this software and he helps you grow as a student but also as a computing student towards coding.</p>
