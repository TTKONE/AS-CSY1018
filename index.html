    <p class="myclass">Hi, I am currently in my first year of university studying Business computing (systems) In the University of Northampton. Within this website- I have created several pages that relate to myself and my course. The first one I will introduce is the home page- which you are currently reading from right now. Next is a portfolio which includes place order images that are associated with web development, that will be replaced in the next upcoming weeks with my term 2 modules. The next page I will be discussing is the contact page. This includes all my contact information and a form that asks you to insert your email address, that will automatically open up your email software on your laptop or computer. My CV will be my next page that shows my previous achievements alongside my education and employment. Lastly, I have a report that will contain my experiences of learning the basics of web development which also includes my ups and downs and my design decisions that I have made to ultimately create my final website. </p>
